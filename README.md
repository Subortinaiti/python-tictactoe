# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python and the Pygame library. The game features a graphical interface and allows two players to take turns placing their symbols on a 3x3 grid. The game ends when one player gets three in a row or when the board is full, resulting in a tie.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installing Dependencies

## Running the Game

Execute the `tic_tac_toe.py` script to start the game:

## How to Play

- The game starts with a random player, either 'Crosses' or 'Circles'.
